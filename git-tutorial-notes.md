# Git Tutorial Notes

## 23 Jan 2022 (Sun) - Git Team Glossary and Use of BRANCHES
1. It's good for a team of collaborators to develop their own GIT glossary to enable smooth communication.
2. A BRANCH is a full copy of the MASTER BRANCH that you can work on INDEPENDENTLY without affecting the MASTER BRANCH.
3. In a BRANCH you can add new commits, new features, new folders, new images if it's a WORKING DIRECTORY for creating a website for example, new code in general, and so on, and then add this as a first commit, second commit, and so on commit.
4. Once your done with all your CHANGES IN YIOUR BRANCH, you can add these changes back to the MASTER BRANCH. 
5. Adding your changes in your BRANCH to the MASTER BRANCH is called MERGE.
6. Great benefit of GIT is that we can add features or any improvements (through the use of BRANCHES) in the RUNNING VERSION OF THE PROJECT, which is the MASTER BRANCH.  CLEARLY, GIT ALLOWS FOR THE AGILE SCRUM APPROACH OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT!!!
7. We can refer to BRANCHES as basically SUB FOLDERS INSIDE A GIT PROJECT, wHERE EACH COLLABORATOR IS WORKING INDEPENDENTLY ON DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE PROJECT, WITHOUT HAVING AN IMPACT ON THE ACTUAL RUNNING VERSION OF THE PROJECT.
