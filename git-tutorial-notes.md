# Git Tutorial Notes

### 23 Jan 2022 (Sun) - Git Team Glossary and Use of BRANCHES
1. It's good for a team of collaborators to develop their own GIT glossary to enable smooth communication.
2. A BRANCH is a full copy of the MASTER BRANCH that you can work on INDEPENDENTLY without affecting the MASTER BRANCH.
3. In a BRANCH you can add new commits, new features, new folders, new images if it's a WORKING DIRECTORY for creating a website for example, new code in general, and so on, and then add this as a first commit, second commit, and so on commit.
4. Once your done with all your CHANGES IN YIOUR BRANCH, you can add these changes back to the MASTER BRANCH. 
5. Adding your changes in your BRANCH to the MASTER BRANCH is called MERGE.
6. Great benefit of GIT is that we can add features or any improvements (through the use of BRANCHES) in the RUNNING VERSION OF THE PROJECT, which is the MASTER BRANCH.  CLEARLY, GIT ALLOWS FOR THE AGILE SCRUM APPROACH OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT!!!
7. We can refer to BRANCHES as basically SUB FOLDERS INSIDE A GIT PROJECT, wHERE EACH COLLABORATOR IS WORKING INDEPENDENTLY ON DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE PROJECT, WITHOUT HAVING AN IMPACT ON THE ACTUAL RUNNING VERSION OF THE PROJECT.

### 23 Jan (Sun) - Git Installation Using MacOS Terminal
1. There are many ways to install GIT in macOS as listed below:
1.1 Homebrew - by using the command "brew install git"
1.1.1 But first download and install Homebrew from the URL https://brew.sh
1.2 After installing GIT through the the command "brew install git" at your terminal, type the command "git --version" to check whether GIT was successfully installed and to find out whether you have the latest version installed.
1.2.1 The latest version of GIT is indicate at the Apple Monitor at this URL https://git-scm.com
1.3 n case, it's not showing the latest GIT version, simply exit the terminal and open another terminal, which may do the trick. 

2. Xcode and many more, but I recommend Homebrew.

### 23 Jan (Sun) - Visual Studio Code Installation in MacOS
1. Since the example project in the tutorial is to create a website, we will install the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) VISUAL SUDIO CODE.
2. VISUAL CODE STUDIO is free, commonly, and widely used IDE platform.
3. Take note that VISUAL CODE STUDIO is a CROSS PLATFORM, which means that it works for both windows and macOS
4. To download and install the VUSUAL CODE STUDIO, go to this url  https://code.visualstudio.com/
5. After downloading VISUAL CODE STUDIO, double click the downloaded file.
6. Then, a security notification will pop up stating that "Visual Studio Code can't be opened because it was not downloaded from the App Store. Your security preferences allow installation of only apps from the App Store."
6.1 There is a workaround for this to allow the installation of Visual Studio Code. Follow the below steps:
6.1.1 Click the Apple icon at the uppen left corner of your screen and select "System Preferences ..." to open the System Preferences page.
6.1.2 In the System Preferences page, double click "Security & Privacy" to ope the Security & Privacy page.
6.1.3 In the Security & Privacy page, go to the "General" tab. 
6.1.4 In the General tab page, you'll see a not at the left of the "Open Anyway" button stating ""Visual Studio Code" was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer." 
6.1.5 You'll also see in this "General"tab that "App Store" is selected for "Allow apps downloaded from:" 
6.1.5.1 To change the "App Store" selection to "App Store and Identified developers", click the podlock icon found at the bottom left corner of this page to unlock it and enable you to make the change on setting.
6.1.6 After unlocking the padlock icon to lock it, select "App Store and Identified developers" and click the "Open Anyway" button.
6.1.7 Then, click again the padlock icon to lock it.
6.1.8 Finally, go back to the VISUAL STUDIO CODE to open the dowloaded file and install it. This time, you should be able to install it!
